We designed a user flow to assist users in navigating the system. We created this app using modern technologies like Python, React, and Node.js. While developing this app, we used an Application Programme Interface(API) to add custom functionalities and enhance the app's privacy and security. After designing, we did an on-site usability test for our application, where we showed our application to 10 users for usability tests. It turned out to be a successful and productive app.
